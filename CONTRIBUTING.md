# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/datadog-aws-controltower.git
```

Test your changes to ensure the CloudFormation template can still create the required resources.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
